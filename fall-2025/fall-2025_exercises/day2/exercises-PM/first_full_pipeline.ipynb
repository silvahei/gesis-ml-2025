So this is a piece of legislation thats not necessary, in my judgment.\\n\\nHe continued: Im the one who decides what we take to the floor, he said. Thats my responsibility as the majority leader and we will not be having this on the floor of the Senate.\\n\\nMcConnells comments come days before the Senate judiciary committee is expected to consider the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, a bipartisan bill that is a compromise between two rival plans. The legislation, written by the Republican senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and the Democratic senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Chris Coons of Delaware, would codify regulations limiting who can fire a special counsel.\\n\\nThe bill would also provide the special counsel a 10-day window during which the special counsel could seek an expedited judicial review by a panel of judges to determine if the removal was justified. If the judges determined that it was not and the firing violated the good-cause requirement, the termination would be reversed.\\n\\nWhile the effort has attracted bipartisan support, Republicans remain broadly opposed to the bill, with several members of the caucus questioning the constitutionality of such legislation. The Republicans who support the bill, including Graham and Tillis, say they too dont believe Trump will fire Mueller and have tried to cast the effort as good policy rather than a response to the mounting public tensions between the president and the special counsel.\\n\\nMcConnell added during the interview that Trump would never agree to the legislation, even if Congress passed it.\\n\\nJust as a practical matter, even if we pass it, why would he sign it? McConnell said.\\n\\nTrump has publicly attacked the Russia investigation as a witch-hunt and has reportedly ordered Muellers firing on at least two occasions. Last week, after a raid to seize documents from his personal lawyer by a separate division of the FBI, Trump lashed out on Twitter, calling the investigation an attack on our country. He has publicly criticized Mueller and Rod Rosenstein, the Department of Justice official overseeing Muellers investigation.\\n\\nThe Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, urged Republicans on the Senate judiciary committee to still allow the bill to move forward and said he hoped that their persistence would push McConnell to reconsider.\\n\\nWhile Im glad the majority leader believes the president would be wrong to fire Special Counsel Mueller, its a mistake not to pass legislation to protect the investigation, Schumer said in a statement. We ought to head off a constitutional crisis at the pass, rather than waiting until its too late.\",\n          \"Four of the worlds biggest tech platforms have working partnerships with a left-wing nonprofit that has a track record of inaccuracies and routinely labels conservative organizations as hate groups.\\n\\nFacebook, Amazon, Google and Twitter all work with or consult the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in policing their platforms for hate speech or hate groups, a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation found.\\n\\nThe SPLC is on a list of external experts and organizations that Facebook works with to inform our hate speech policies, Facebook spokeswoman Ruchika Budhraja told TheDCNF in an interview.\\n\\nFacebook consults the outside organizations when developing changes to hate speech policies, Budhraja said, noting that Facebook representatives will typically hold between one and three meetings with the groups.\",\n          \"A New York jury has awarded damages to Eugenie Bouchard, the tennis star who dropped out of the US Open after a fall in a trainer's room.\\n\\nThe 23-year-old Canadian slipped on a cleaning substance on the floor after playing a late-night match on 4 September 2015, suffering a concussion.\\n\\nShe did not play for the rest of the 2015 season and her world ranking has since dropped below the top 100.\\n\\nThe former Wimbledon finalist is seeking millions in lost earnings.\\n\\nThe United States Tennis Association (USTA) was found to be responsible for 75% of her damages after the jury in Brooklyn deliberated for less than one hour on Thursday evening.\\n\\n\\\"When you get 75% or better, you can't ever complain about that,\\\" Benedict Morelli, Bouchard's lawyer, told reporters after the jury's decision.\\n\\nDuring her trial, the Montreal native said she had fallen flat on her back.\\n\\nBouchard told the court she could feel the chemical cleaning agents burning her skin \\\"all over me\\\".\\n\\nShe testified: \\\"I screamed, 'Oh my God, it burns!'\\\"\\n\\nThe injury took place in the locker room at the Queens facility, after cleaning workers applied a substance to the floor thinking that all the players had left for the day.\\n\\n\\\"We just assumed that she had left,\\\" testified trainer Kristy Stahr, on behalf of USTA.\\n\\nAccording to the New York Times, the damages phase of the trial takes place on Friday at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\\n\\nThe hearing will determine how much the injury cost Bouchard, whose world ranking has since dropped from Number 6 to 116.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
